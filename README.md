# Splash - Unsplash Clone

Splash is a simple Unsplash clone built with **Vue 3's Composition API**. It allows users to search for photos using the **Unsplash API** and displays the results with infinite scrolling for a smooth and dynamic user experience. Splash is designed to be lightweight and responsive.

#### The demo is hosted [here](https://siteurl).

## Features
